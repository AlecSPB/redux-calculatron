## my first lines of react code!

this is how far i got in around five hours, from zero knowledge of react. I started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and went from there.  

## Running

just check out, run npm install, then start the proxy + the app with `npm start`

## Stuff i didn't get to yet
Testing, obviously. Form validation, and error handling. A nice stacked bar chart showing the composition of the payment (increasing principal, decreasing interest) over time.
I'll try to add all this within the next few days, but wanted to show where i was after, well, the alloted time.
